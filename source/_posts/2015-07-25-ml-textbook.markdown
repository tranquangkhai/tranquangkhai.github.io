## Machine Learning: A Probabilistic Perspective

I will use this book to learn ML because it is similar to Bishop's Pattern recognition and machine learning.
But it's algorithms are implemented in Matlab/Octave and it also contains the new contents such as deep learning.

[Book's link](http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~murphyk/MLbook/)

## The supplementary

When I use this book to learn ML, I will use the following materials too.

* Matlab/Octave source code [pmtk3](https://github.com/probml/pmtk3)

* A learning course which uses this book as a textbook. [ML's course](http://www.inf.ed.ac.uk/teaching/courses/mlpr/)
